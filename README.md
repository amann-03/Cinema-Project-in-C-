Cinema Ticket Booking System

This project is a C program that simulates a cinema ticket booking system. 
It allows users to book tickets, check time slots, and view their ticket status. 
The program uses file handling to store booking records and ticket details.

Features:

Prebooking: Users can book tickets for movies by selecting a movie code, screen, and time slot (morning or evening). The program prompts the user to enter the movie code, number of persons, and mobile number for confirmation.
Time Slot: Users can check the available time slots for a particular movie on different screens.
My Tickets: Users can check the status of their booked tickets by entering their registered mobile number and booking number.
Exit: Users can exit the program at any time.

How to Use ?

Compile and run the program.
Select the desired option from the menu (1. Prebooking, 2. Timeslot, 3. MyTickets, or 4. Exit).
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the selected task.
